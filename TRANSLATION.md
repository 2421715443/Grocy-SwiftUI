# Translation in other languages

You are welcome to translate Grocy Mobile into other languages.
For this, I have decided to use Transifex, since Grocy and Grocy Android use it too. It is free for open source projects.
[Find Grocy Mobile on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/keine-5/grocy-mobile/).

If you don't know how to use Transifex yet, please use the [official Guide](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started-1/translators).

Please don't hesitate to ask if there is a problem and happy translating!
